I am IT Professional with over 15 years of experience with large-scale projects in telcos and financial institutions. My main focus is on virtualization and cloud deployments. I have advanced knowledge of Kubernetes, currently I am
Certified Kubernetes Administrator. Due to my interest in docker and k8s I started learning the Go language. I am proficient with Couchbase and Kafka.
I do have a deep knowledge of Java and related ecosystem. Working knowledge of Java since version 1.3.

I am constantly expanding my portfolio of programming languages to Javascript/Typescript, Python and Clojure. I believe the different programming paradigms are improving my performance in IT.

I have an intermediate knowledge of SQL and relational database systems, mainly Oracle Database. I can indeed work with any SQL based database, but on Oracle I am also capable to do some simple administrative tasks and performance tuning.
