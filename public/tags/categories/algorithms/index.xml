      <description>Graph representation    Types of graph:
 Undirected graph Directed graph Weighted graph  Adjacency matrix    Adjacency matrix stores the edges in a matrix. Adjacency matrix for this graph would be
    0 1 2 3     0 0 1 0 1   1 1 0 1 1   2 0 1 0 0   3 1 1 0 0    This is undirected unweighted graph so we represent every edge by simple 1.</description>

      <description>Breadth first search    Fundamental algorithm to search the tree or graph. It runs in O(V + E) time, where V is vertex and E is edge. Using intermediate memory to store the same level nodes. It also has to mark the nodes as visited.</description>
