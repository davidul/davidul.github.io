      <description>Prime numbers    Prime number is a number which is divisible by 1 and self. For example 7 is divisible only by 1 and 7. Brute force searching for prime number - try each number 2,3, &amp;hellip; N-1.</description>

      <description>Priority queue    Priority queue is similar to normal queue or stack, except every element has a priority. Priority queue is usually implemented as heap.
Heap    Heap is a tree data structure, it is almost complete binary tree. Common implementation of heap is the binary heap.
left child 2i+1
right child 2i+2
parent i / 2 - 1</description>

      <description>Graph representation    Types of graph:
 Undirected graph Directed graph Weighted graph  Adjacency matrix    Adjacency matrix stores the edges in a matrix. Adjacency matrix for this graph would be
   0 1 2 3     0 0 1 0 1   1 1 0 1 1   2 0 1 0 0   3 1 1 0 0    This is undirected unweighted graph so we represent every edge by simple 1.</description>

      <description>Breadth first search    Fundamental algorithm to search the tree or graph. It runs in O(V + E) time, where V is vertex and E is edge. Using intermediate memory to store the same level nodes. It also has to mark the nodes as visited.
